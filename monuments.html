    <h2>The Holocaust Memorial</h2>
    <p>The most striking part of the Miami Holocaust Monument is a 13 metre bronze 
        hand, over which clamber hundreds of tormented human shapes. The figures are
         carefully sculpted, and in their detail powerfully transmit the despair and
          anguish of the subject matter.</p>
    <p>The monument also includes a dark stone tunnel, with the names of the 
        concentration camps carved into the walls, as a representation of the 
        solitude and isolation the Jews felt during their persecution.</p>
    <p>An enormous wall nearby also bears the names of the millions of victims to 
        have died during the atrocity.</p>

    <h2>Torch of Friendship</h2>
    <p>The Torch of Friendship is a monument built in 1960 located at the northwest 
        corner of Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami.</p>
    <p>The Torch of Friendship was built to signify the passageway for immigrants coming 
        from Latin America and the Caribbean. The gas fed flame was meant to act as a 
        welcoming beacon for all new and old immigrants to the nation. 
        In 1964 it was re-dedicated to the memory of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
    <p>It consists of a pillar, covered with stone plates and topped by a burning torch. 
        It holds a plate with the Great Seal of the United States at the front. 
        Underneath a plate holds a caption in which the city of Miami dedicates this 
        monument to the friendship between the US and the Latin American countries. 
        It also has the year of construction, 1960.</p>
    <p>The pilar is escorted by a curved wall in which appears the re-dedication of the monument, 
        in memory of John F. Kennedy. To its right, the words TORCH OF FRIENDSHIP appear 
        above 20 round plates showing the coat of arms and names of Latin American countries.</p>

    <h3>Statue dedicated to Simón Bolívar</h3>
    <p>The statue of Simón Bolívar was dedicated in Bayfront Park on December 17, 1984.</p>
    <p>It watextarea>s a gift from the government of Venezuela in 1979 and was stored in a Miami warehouse for 
        several years before being dedicated. After the redevelopment of the park the bronze 
        figure was renovated and rededicated in 1991 in the northern end of the park alongside 
        the Torch of Friendship.</p>
